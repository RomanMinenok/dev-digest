# client — Insights

Accumulated, hard-won lessons for `@devdigest/web` — the things that bit us and
shouldn't bite us twice. Referenced from `client/CLAUDE.md` ("read when…").

## What Works
<!-- Approaches/solutions that worked. e.g. "X via Y in src/foo.ts:42 because …" -->

## What Doesn't Work
<!-- Dead ends & antipatterns. The most valuable & most-skipped section. -->
- The client has its own vendored copy of shared contracts at `client/src/vendor/shared/contracts/` that is **not auto-synced** with `server/src/vendor/shared/contracts/`. Adding a field to the server copy alone passes server typecheck but breaks client typecheck. Always mirror changes to both copies (`trace.ts` and `platform.ts` were both affected in the cost feature).

## Codebase Patterns
<!-- Conventions & architectural decisions, with the "why". -->
- Components shared across a **route subtree** (parent + its `[param]` children) belong in the parent's `_components/` folder, not in `src/components/`. Example: `SeverityChips` is used by both `pulls/_components/PRRow` and `pulls/[number]/_components/RunHistory`, so it lives at `pulls/_components/SeverityChips/`. Only promote to `src/components/` when used across unrelated routes.
- **Lazy hover-fetch pattern** (React Query): use `enabled: hovered && !!id && hasData` to defer the network call until the user actually hovers over the trigger. Pair with `staleTime: 30_000` to avoid refetching on repeated hovers within 30 s. Implemented in `pulls/_components/PRRow/PRRow.tsx` for the findings popover — avoids N requests on initial list render.
- **Mismatched hover zones between a block wrapper and an inline-flex child cause popover to never show** — `PRRow` tracked `chipsHovered` on a full-width block `<div>` around `SeverityChips` to gate the lazy fetch. `SeverityChips` tracked its own `hovered` on the smaller `inline-flex` chips area to show the popover. The fetch fired from the large zone; the popover showed from the small zone — they rarely overlapped in practice. Fix: fetch eagerly (gated by `hasFindings`, not by hover) so findings are already loaded when the user hovers the chips. See `PRRow.tsx` — `enabled: !!pr.id && hasFindings` with no hover gate.
- **Moving hover state inside a component breaks callers that depended on external hover** — `RunSeverityChips` used `enabled: hovered` for lazy React Query fetch, where `hovered` came from its own `useState`. When the hover zone (+ popover) moved inside `SeverityChips`, `RunSeverityChips` lost the hover signal and the fetch never fired. Fix: move the data fetch one level up to `RunHistory` (one `useQuery` per PR page, keyed by `prId`) and pass findings down as props. React Query deduplication still guarantees a single network request even if multiple child components share the same `queryKey`. See `RunHistory.tsx:findingsByRunId`.
- **Absolutely-positioned popovers inside table rows are clipped by `overflow: hidden`** — `FindingsPopover` used `position: absolute` relative to `SeverityChips`'s wrapper, which is inside a PR list row. The row (or a grid ancestor) has `overflow: hidden`, so the popover was cut off. Fix: use `createPortal(card, document.body)` + `position: fixed` with coordinates from `ref.current.getBoundingClientRect()` captured on mouseenter. The portal escapes all clipping ancestors. See `FindingsPopover.tsx` + `SeverityChips.tsx:handleMouseEnter`.
- **`pointerEvents: none` on hover popovers** — when a popover is absolutely positioned over its trigger and the popover itself doesn't need to be interactive, set `pointerEvents: none`. Without it, moving the mouse from the trigger div into the popover card fires `mouseLeave` on the trigger and immediately hides the popover, causing flicker. See `FindingsPopover.tsx:44`. If the popover needs to be interactive (links, buttons), extend the hover zone to cover both trigger + popover instead.
- **Filter badge counts must come from the raw (unfiltered) array, not the filtered result** — in `FindingsPanel`, `severityCounts` is computed from `findings` (the full prop), not from `shown` (the filtered output). If it used `shown`, clicking a chip would mutate the counts on all other chips to reflect only the filtered subset, making them jump around. Computing from the source array keeps chip labels stable regardless of the active filter. See `FindingsPanel.tsx:32-39`.
- **Dynamic `Icon` component lookup requires two casts** — `Icon[name as keyof typeof Icon] as React.ComponentType<{ size?: number }>`. The first cast (`keyof typeof Icon`) satisfies the TS index signature; the second (`as React.ComponentType<...>`) is needed because the namespace type is a union of all icon shapes and TS cannot infer JSX callability from it. Without both casts you get either an index error or "JSX element type does not have any construct or call signatures". See `FindingsPanel.tsx:71`.

## Tool & Library Notes
<!-- Dependency quirks, version gotchas, env/config oddities. -->
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars are inlined into the bundle at **start time** (`next dev` / `next build`), not at request time. Changing a `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` value in `.env` requires a dev-server restart to take effect — a page refresh is not enough.

## Recurring Errors & Fixes
<!-- Error signature → root cause → fix. -->
- **`textDecoration: underline` has no effect on SVG icons inside `display: inline-flex`** — root cause: `text-decoration` only draws under text nodes, not SVG children. Fix: use `borderBottom: "1px solid/dashed/dotted <color>"` + `paddingBottom: 2` on the `inline-flex` span instead — border applies to the element box and covers both icon and number. See `SeverityChips.tsx` interactive chip style.
- **`TS2322: Type 'number | null | undefined' is not assignable to type 'number | null'` in `RunHistory.test.tsx`** — root cause: `RunSummary` gained a new `nullable()` field (not `nullish()`), so the `Partial<RunSummary>` factory in the test fixture no longer satisfies the full type. Fix: add the new field with an explicit `null` default inside the `run()` factory function (`RunHistory.test.tsx:30`).
